# CLAUDE.md — seqdex-web

The standalone SeqDEX site. Read DESIGN.md first; it is the architecture
contract (surfaces, books, settlement phases, provider dependencies).

## Rules

- **No unified order book.** The three surfaces are separate rooms by
  product decision (user directive 2026-08-12): LNDEX (`/seqob-pln`,
  `lightning.ln_direction` 2 or 3 only), on-chain (`/seqob`), confidential
  (`/seqob-conf`, `pair.confidential == true` only). Do not merge them.
- **The wallet drives everything sensitive.** No keys, no signing, no
  invoice handling in this repo; extend
  `sequentia-extension/doc/PROVIDER.md` first when a flow needs a new
  primitive, then consume it here.
- LNDEX = pure LN only. Submarine offers (ln_direction 0/1) and sub-asset
  offers (4/5) are the web wallet's business, never shown here.
- Confidential DEX never gets a BTC leg (Bitcoin has no CT).
- Static ES modules, no bundler. Surface accents are informational
  (violet LN, gold chain, teal confidential); keep them consistent.
- Public copy: no em dashes; "Sequentia" is never abbreviated to SEQ; the
  token is "the Sequence token (SEQ)".

## Deploy

Box clone `/srv/seqdex-web` (must live outside /root: Caddy's file_server runs as the caddy user and cannot traverse /root); Caddy serves it via `handle_path
/dex/*` + `file_server` (Caddyfile on the box, backup before editing,
`caddy validate` + `systemctl reload caddy`). Flow: commit → push →
`git pull` on the box. Nothing to build.

## Endpoints consumed

Same-origin under sequentiatestnet.com: `/registry/index.minimal.json`,
`/prices`, the `/seqob`, `/seqob-pln` and `/seqob-conf` relay mounts
(`/seqob-chan` is reserved in `shared/book.js` and not deployed). All
read-only from the site; fills and orders go through the wallet's `dex*`
provider methods, which talk to the relay themselves.

## Working with git and GitHub here

These rules are the same in every Sequentia repository. They are repeated in each
one because this file is the only thing an agent is guaranteed to read, whatever
machine it is working from.

**Nothing pushed to GitHub credits Claude, Anthropic, or any AI tool.** No
`Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer, no `Claude-Session:` trailer or `claude.ai`
link, no "Generated with Claude Code" in a commit message or a pull request body,
no `claude/*` branch names or session ids, and no mention in source, comments,
docs or issue text. Agent tooling offers several of these by default; compose the
message without them rather than stripping them afterwards.

**Author every commit as**
`GracedEternalKingCabbageMan <151803062+GracedEternalKingCabbageMan@users.noreply.github.com>`.
Never a personal address.

**Every change lands through a pull request that you merge yourself, at once.**
There is no reviewer on this project; the pull request exists so the reasoning is
recorded beside the diff. Branch, push, open it, merge it, delete the branch, all
in one sitting. Pushing straight to the default branch is the rule most often
broken here, and it is the one that costs the record. A pull request stays open
only when the repository owner asks for that specific one, and that never carries
over to the next.

**Name branches `area/short-description`**: `fix/`, `doc/`, `feature/`, `test/`,
`build/`, or the component being changed. Never a tool name, a session id, or
`worktree-*`.

**Write the subject as `area: what changed`**, one line, 72 characters at the
outside and 50 where you can manage it. Put the reasoning in the body, and
explain why rather than what.

**These repositories are public and world-readable.** Never commit private keys,
seeds, `wallet.dat`, RPC credentials, `.env` files or API tokens. Read the diff
before every commit. Secrets belong on the server and in offline backups.

**A file belongs to the repository whose code it describes.** Decide which repo
owns it before writing it; if it landed in the wrong one, move it rather than
deleting it.

**Documentation is part of the change, not a follow-up.** A change that makes a
README, a doc page, a runbook or a code comment wrong is not finished until that
text is right again, in the same pull request as the code. Before you open the
pull request, search the repository for whatever you renamed, moved or removed —
the old binary name, the old path, the old flag, the old command — and fix every
hit. If the change falsifies another repository's documentation, that repository
gets its own pull request in the same sitting. A stale instruction costs a new
user more than a missing one: they trust it, run it, it fails, and the failure
reads as broken software rather than as an out-of-date sentence.

**Write documentation to be timeless.** Assume the reader is new, arrived today,
and wants to know what the software is and how to use it right now. They do not
care what changed, what it used to be called, or which version added what. So
write in the present tense about current behaviour, and leave the history out:
no changelogs, no "new in", no "recently", no "coming soon", no status or
progress sections, no roadmaps, no dated notes. Quote a version number only where
the reader cannot act without it, and prefer pointing at the file that carries it
over copying the digits. Timeless does not mean thin — what the product is, who
it is for, and how to install, configure and use it all still belong there, in
full. Documentation written this way survives a release without an edit, which is
what keeps it true; the history already has homes in the git log, the tags and
the release notes.

**Push the same day you commit.** The testnet server pulls only from GitHub, so a
branch left on one laptop is invisible to every other machine and to the box.
